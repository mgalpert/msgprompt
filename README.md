# msgprompt
The simplest way to preprompt Claude and ChatGPT.

## Preprompting!?!

Research shows that preprompting (providing context and instruction before your main query) significantly improves AI responses.

When I first heard about this technique I ran [tests with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity](https://x.com/msg/status/1848476183165583824), and learned that preprompted queries produced better and more detailed responses.

However, manually writing preprompts can be:
- Time-consuming
- Inconsistent
- Easy to forget

MSGPrompt solves this by having your LLM provide a prompt for your LLM. yo dawg
